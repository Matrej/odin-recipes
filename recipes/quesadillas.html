        <h1>Mouth melting Quesadillas</h1>
        <p>I came up with this one night when I didn't know what to cook. I had leftover steak in the fridge, so I decided to get creative. These came out wonderful! The measurements are approximations, so feel free to change them according to your tastes. Serve with salsa, guacamole, and sour cream.</p>
        <h2>For this recipe you will need:</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
            <li>½ green bell pepper, sliced</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>4 flour tortillas</li>
            <li>½ pound cooked steak, cut into 1/4-inch thick pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and green bell pepper in the hot oil until onions are softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Season mixture with salt and transfer to a bowl. </li>
            <li>Brush 1 side of each tortilla with remaining oil. Place 1 tortilla, oil-side down, in the same skillet; sprinkle with 1/2 the steak, 1/2 the onion mixture, and 1/2 the Mexican cheese mixture. Place a second tortilla, oil-side up, onto cheese layer, pressing down with a spatula to seal. </li>
            <li>Cook quesadilla over medium heat until cheese melts and tortillas are browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove quesadilla from skillet and cut into wedges. Repeat with remaining ingredients for second quesadilla. </li>
        </ol>
